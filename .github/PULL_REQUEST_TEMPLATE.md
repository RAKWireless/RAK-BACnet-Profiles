## 🧪 Test Verification

### Test Data

Please provide at least 2 sets of test data for verification:

**Test Case 1:**
```
fPort: 
Uplink Data (Hex): 
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    
  ]
}
```

---

**Test Case 2:**
```
fPort: 
Uplink Data (Hex): 
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    
  ]
}
```

---

### Verification Method

Test codec functions using the Node.js validation script:

```bash
node scripts/test-codec.js \
  -f profiles/<Vendor>/<Model>.yaml \
  -p <fPort> \
  -u <hex_data>
```

**Verification Result**:
<!-- Paste command output -->
```
